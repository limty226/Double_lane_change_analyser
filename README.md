# 🚗 Double Lane Change Data Processing in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script for processing and analyzing **Double Lane Change (DLC) experiment data**.  
The script extracts **vehicle trajectory, velocity, effort, time, and error metrics** from a Simulink simulation and visualizes the results.

---

## 📦 Features

✅ **Reference Path Generation**  
- Generates a reference trajectory for a double lane change.  
- Defines **left and right boundary cones** for the track.

✅ **Vehicle Data Extraction**  
- Loads **vehicle position, velocity, and yaw angle** from Simulink logs.  
- Computes derived metrics such as **velocity change and angular deviation**.

✅ **Performance Analysis**  
- Measures **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** from the reference path.  
- Computes **effort** based on steering angle changes.  
- Counts the number of **boundary cone violations**.

✅ **Data Visualization**  
- Plots **vehicle trajectory** along with lane boundaries.  
- Generates **histograms** for error distribution.

✅ **Data Saving**  
- Saves processed experiment results (**Time, Error, Effort, Velocity**) in `.mat` format.

## 🔹 Simulink Model
The Simulink model included in this repository simulates teleoperation-based Double Lane Change experiments.
It models the vehicle dynamics and generates .mat files for further analysis.

To run the Simulink model:

1️⃣ Open models/double_lane_change.slx in Simulink.

2️⃣ Set up the simulation parameters.

3️⃣ Run the model and generate the .mat data for analysis.

## 📊 Output Data Structure

The script outputs the following variables:

| Variable   | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Time`     | Elapsed time during the experiment                  |
| `Error`    | RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the vehicle's path |
| `Effort`   | Cumulative steering effort                          |
| `Velocity` | Average vehicle speed                               |
| `conerxcnt` | Number of cone boundary violations                  |

## 📁 Output Data
The processed .mat files will be saved in the following directory:

📂 `output/`

  ├── `participant1_20230522.mat`
  
  ├── `participant2_20230522.mat`
  
  ├── `all_vehicle_data.mat`
  
Make sure to check this directory after running the experiment.

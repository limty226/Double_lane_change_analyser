# üöó Double Lane Change Data Processing in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script for processing and analyzing **Double Lane Change (DLC) experiment data**.  
The script extracts **vehicle trajectory, velocity, effort, time, and error metrics** from a Simulink simulation and visualizes the results.

---

## üì¶ Features

‚úÖ **Reference Path Generation**  
- Generates a reference trajectory for a double lane change.  
- Defines **left and right boundary cones** for the track.

‚úÖ **Vehicle Data Extraction**  
- Loads **vehicle position, velocity, and yaw angle** from Simulink logs.  
- Computes derived metrics such as **velocity change and angular deviation**.

‚úÖ **Performance Analysis**  
- Measures **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** from the reference path.  
- Computes **effort** based on steering angle changes.  
- Counts the number of **boundary cone violations**.

‚úÖ **Data Visualization**  
- Plots **vehicle trajectory** along with lane boundaries.  
- Generates **histograms** for error distribution.

‚úÖ **Data Saving**  
- Saves processed experiment results (**Time, Error, Effort, Velocity**) in `.mat` format.

## üìä Output Data Structure

The script outputs the following variables:

| Variable   | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Time`     | Elapsed time during the experiment                  |
| `Error`    | RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the vehicle's path |
| `Effort`   | Cumulative steering effort                          |
| `Velocity` | Average vehicle speed                               |
| `conerxcnt` | Number of cone boundary violations                  |
